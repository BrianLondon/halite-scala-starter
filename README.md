This is a restructuring of the [Halite](http://halite.io) starter bot for Scala. It keeps the original API, but adds some features for running multiple bots, which can be seen by inspecting the main application in src/main/scala/MyBot.scala.  The logic of the basic bot included in the starter kit is now in src/main/scala/bot/DumbBot.scala.

Setup instructions:
 - Clone the repository
 - Install [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Setup.html) for your platform.
 - Copy the halite executable (obtainable from [here](https://halite.io/learn-programming-challenge/downloads-and-starter-kits/)) for your platform (Windows, MacOS, or Linux) into the root directory of the repo.
 - Run `run_game.sh`
